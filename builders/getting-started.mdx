## What You Get

Pay 110 ELTA, launch an app, get a token. That's it.

Your app ships with:
- **1 billion tokens** — 50% yours (auto-staked), 50% for sale
- **Bonding curve** — price goes up as people buy
- **Staking vault** — users stake, everyone earns fees
- **Tournaments & items** — add them later if you want

No Solidity. No audits. No fundraising. Just build your app and deploy.

<Warning>
  **Testnet**: Currently on Base Sepolia. Mainnet coming soon. Perfect time to test your launch.

---

**2. Get ELTA**

Need 110 ELTA. On testnet, DM us. On mainnet, buy on Uniswap.

**3. Launch**

Go to [app.elata.bio/launch](https://app.elata.bio/launch):
1. Connect wallet
2. Enter name, symbol, description
3. Upload image
4. Approve + confirm

**4. Upload your app**

On your new app page, drag your folder into "Upload / Replace Game."

Done. App is live.

## Under the Hood

When you hit "Launch":

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant Factory
    participant Token
    participant Curve
    participant Vault
    
    You->>Factory: createApp() + 110 ELTA
    Factory->>Token: Deploy app token (1B supply)
    Factory->>Curve: Deploy bonding curve
    Factory->>Vault: Deploy staking vault
    Token->>You: 500M tokens (auto-staked)
    Token->>Curve: 500M tokens for public sale
    Factory-->>You: App live!
```

The factory deploys three contracts:
- **Token** — your app's ERC-20
- **Curve** — handles buy/sell pricing
- **Vault** — staking for fee distribution

Your 500M tokens are staked immediately. You're earning from trade one.

---

## After Launch

**Immediately:**
- Upload your game files
- Share the link
- Add social links and team members in settings

**Later:**
- Add items (NFTs) and tournaments
- Run competitions
- Iterate based on feedback

**Your stake:**

Your 50% is auto-staked. You earn from every trade. You can unstake anytime, but it's visible on-chain — keeping it staked signals commitment to buyers.
