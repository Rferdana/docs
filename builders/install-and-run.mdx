title: "Getting started"
---

Welcome to Elata’s machine-learning stack for brain and physiological data.

This repo is where you:

- Ingest and organize raw signals (e.g. EEG and related streams)
- Build, train, and evaluate ML models
- Expose models via CLI tools and a web application
- Share reproducible experiments through notebooks and versioned model artifacts

This page is your **landing hub**:

- A quick mental model of the repo
- How branches are typically used
- Where to go next depending on what you’re trying to do

If you just want to run _something_ locally right away, skip ahead to [**Pick your path**](#pick-your-path).

## What lives in this repo?

`brain-ml` is designed as a _full stack_ ML workspace:

- **`Core library (src/)`**\
  Data loading, preprocessing, feature pipelines, model definitions, training/eval loops, and shared utilities.
- **`Web app (webapp/)`**\
  Frontend for visualizing runs, inspecting datasets, and interacting with trained models through a browser. This is where “non-ML” teammates usually live.
- **`Notebooks (notebooks/)`**\
  Research and exploration: quick experiments, ablation studies, visualizations, and one-off analyses.
- **`Model artifacts (models/)`**\
  Checkpoints, exported weights, and metadata. Typically gitignored; think of this as the “outputs” of your experiments.
- **`Docs (docs/)`**\
  Everything that powers the Mintlify docs site:
  - High-level guides under `/docs/guides/`
  - Tutorials under `/docs/tutorials/`
  - API and SDK reference under `/docs/reference/`
  - This page under `/docs/getting-started/index.md`
- **`Scripts (scripts/)`**\
  Helper scripts for documentation and tooling:
  - `generate_python_docs.sh`: builds Python API docs into `docs/reference/sdk/python/autogenerated/`
  - `generate_typedoc.sh`: builds frontend TypeScript docs into `docs/reference/sdk/typescript/typedoc/`

The **root** also includes standard project files like `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.github/workflows/` for CI, and `.gitignore`.

## Branches: how work is usually organized

`brain-ml` is designed to support multiple parallel tracks of work: production-ready pipelines, active development, and more experimental research. The exact branch names may vary between teams and forks, but you’ll typically see **three kinds of branches**:

1. **Stable / release branches**\
   Long-lived branches that correspond to deployable, stable code (e.g. a `main` or `release/*` branch).
   - Intended for: production deployments, reproducible results, and published docs.
   - CI should be green; tests and core pipelines expected to pass.
2. **Integration / feature branches**\
   Branches where active development happens (e.g. `dev`, `webapp/*`, `pipeline/*`, `feature/*`).
   - Intended for: day-to-day work, integrating new models or data pipelines, webapp changes, etc.
   - May contain breaking changes, WIP experiments, or newer dependencies.
3. **Experiment / research branches**\
   Short-lived branches (often prefixed like `exp/*` or `research/*`) for model or dataset experiments.
   - Intended for: trying new architectures, loss functions, or preprocessing approaches.
   - Not guaranteed to be stable; may never be merged.
