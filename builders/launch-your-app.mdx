</Steps>

### Getting Base Sepolia ETH

1. **[Alchemy Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia)** — Requires Alchemy account
2. **[Coinbase Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/base/sepolia)** — QuickNode faucet
3. **[Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet)** — Works for Base Sepolia

### Getting Testnet ELTA

To get testnet ELTA tokens for launching your app:

1. Follow [@elata_bio](https://x.com/elata_bio) on X/Twitter
2. Post or DM us with your wallet address requesting testnet ELTA
3. We'll send you tokens within 24 hours

<Note>
  Testnet tokens have no monetary value. They're for testing the app launch flow before mainnet.
</Note>

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Go to [app.elata.bio/launch](https://app.elata.bio/launch)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the header
3. Select your wallet provider
4. Approve the connection

<Warning>

</Warning>

## Step 2: Fill in App Details

### App Name

Choose a memorable name for your application:
- 3-50 characters
- Will be displayed in the App Store
- Cannot be changed after launch

**Good examples**: NeuroPong, FocusFlow, BrainWave Trainer

### Token Symbol

Your token's ticker symbol:
- 2-10 characters
- Uppercase letters and numbers only
- Will appear as $SYMBOL in trading

**Good examples**: NPONG, FOCUS, BWT

### Description

Explain what your app does:
- Up to 1,000 characters
- Be specific about features and benefits
- This appears on your app's detail page

### App Image

Upload a square image:
- Recommended: 512x512 pixels
- Formats: PNG, JPG, SVG
- Max size: 5MB
- This becomes your app's icon

---

## Step 3: Approve ELTA

Before creating your app, you need to approve the ELTA spending:

1. Click "Approve ELTA" button
2. Your wallet will show an approval request for 110 ELTA
3. Confirm the transaction
4. Wait for confirmation (~2-5 seconds on Base)

<Note>
  This is a standard ERC-20 approval. You're authorizing the contract to transfer exactly 110 ELTA.
</Note>

---

## Step 4: Create Your App

Once approved:

1. Click "Launch App" button
2. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
3. Wait for the transaction to be mined
4. You'll be redirected to your new app's page

The transaction creates:
- Your app token (1 billion supply)
- Bonding curve for trading
- Staking vault for rewards
- Your 50% allocation (auto-staked)

---

## Step 5: Upload Your Game

Your app page is live, but you need to upload your actual application:

1. On your app's detail page, scroll to "Creator Console"
2. Find the "Upload / Replace Game" section
3. Drag and drop your game folder (must contain `index.html`)
4. Wait for upload to complete

### Game Requirements

Your game/app must:
- Have an `index.html` file at the root
- Be self-contained (all assets included)
- Work in an iframe context

### Supported Technologies

- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- React, Vue, Svelte (compiled)
- Phaser, Three.js, PixiJS, Unity
- Any web framework that compiles to static files

---

## What You Get

After launching, your app includes:

### Token Economics

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Total Supply** | 1,000,000,000 tokens |
| **Your Allocation** | 500,000,000 (50%, auto-staked) |
| **Public Sale** | 500,000,000 (50%, on bonding curve) |
| **Trading Fee** | 1% on all trades |

### Your Earning Potential

As the creator with 50% staked:
- You earn proportionally from the 70% staker share of fees
- If trading volume is 10,000 ELTA/month, you'd earn ~35 ELTA/month

### Infrastructure

- **Staking Vault**: Users can stake your token
- **Bonding Curve**: Fair price discovery
- **Rewards System**: Automatic fee distribution
- **Graduation Path**: Auto-deploy to DEX at 42K ELTA

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction Failed">
    Common causes:
    - Insufficient ELTA balance (need 110)
    - Insufficient ETH for gas
    - Approval not yet confirmed
    
    **Solution**: Check balances, wait for approval confirmation, try again
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Approval Not Working">
    If approval seems stuck:
    - Check transaction on Basescan
    - Try increasing gas price
    - Clear wallet cache and reconnect
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Game Not Uploading">
    Requirements:
    - Must have `index.html` at root
    - Max ~50MB total size
    - No server-side code (static files only)
    
    **Solution**: Verify folder structure, compress assets if needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="App Not Showing">
    After creation, apps may take a few minutes to index:
    - Wait 1-2 minutes
    - Refresh the page
    - Check if transaction succeeded on Basescan
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
