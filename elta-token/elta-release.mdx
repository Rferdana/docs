## Strategy

To maximize alignment and foster sustainable growth, Elata has implemented a 6-year linear vesting schedule exclusively for contributors, as well as . The strategy aims to prioritize the long-term health of the Elata ecosystem by fostering a balanced and sustainable token distribution strategy:

- **Prevent excessive selloffs:** By locking up team tokens, we mitigate the risk of significant contributor sell-offs that could negatively impact the token price and erode community confidence.
- **Encourage long-term commitment:** The extended vesting period incentivizes long-term commitment from the team, aligning their interests with the long-term success of the Elata ecosystem.
- **Facilitate organic price discovery:** Immediate unlocks allows for a more accurate and organic price discovery process. This prevents artificially inflated expectations driven by a low circulating supply and subsequent downward pressure as vested tokens hit the market.
