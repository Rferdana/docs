Elata's governance relies on Vote-escrowed ELTA, also known as veELTA, which enables a higher degree of decentralization as well as a way to incentivize ecosystem commitment. By utilizing veELTA, ELTA holders gain access to an array of features that increase the token's utility and boost ecosystem utilization.

veELTA also serves as an additional mechanism for reducing the circulating supply (aka float) of ELTA tokens, simultaneously increasing price stability and protocol integrity. For these reasons, veELTA serves as an important tool for maintaining the long-term health and success of the ecosystem.

## Getting veELTA

When users lock their ELTA, they receive veELTA. Users' veELTA value is proportional to the amount and duration of veELTA staked (up to a maximum of 2 years). Each wallet is associated with a single vePENDLE expiry date.

veELTA uses a linear decay model — meaning its value will decrease over time — and reaches zero once the lock duration is over. Once this happens, the full principal ELTA deposit will then be unlocked.

The below chart is an example demonstrating the pace and duration at which a 1000 ELTA deposit staked for 2 years decays:

To increase veELTA value throughout its staking period, users can choose to extend their staking duration and/or increase the initial staked amount.
