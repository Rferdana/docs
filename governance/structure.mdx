title: "Structure"
---

Elata utilizes a decentralized governance structure which relies on a multi-step implementation process and is decided by holders of Elata's native token, ELTA. This structure was purpose-built to gradually transition key decision making within Elata from its core stewards to the community over time.

Elata does not have a CEO or Board of Directors. A person or organization verifiably holding any given number of ELTA can become a member automatically depending on their desire to opt-in to governance decisions.

  **PARTICIPATING IN THE GOVERNANCE PROCESS**

  Elata's governance structure relies on participation from ELTA holders to stake the desired portion of tokens from their holdings and vote in accordance to their beliefs.
</Tip>

Elata employs a democratic governance model where each token holder's voting power is directly proportional to their holdings. Specifically, each ELTA token represents one vote, ensuring that governance is distributed among all token holders based on their stake in the DAO. This one token, one vote system is guided by insights from our stewards and core teams to facilitate a community-driven approach where every token holder's voice is heard, proportional to their commitment to the DAO.

Our governance process is outlined below.

## Proposals

Elata initiates projects based on proposals that are submitted by individuals, the engineering team, community, and organizations either internally or externally. In addition, projects are reviewed by relevant Elata teams for scientific, clinical, technological, and business relevance, and proposed for funding. Once funding is released, the Development team or the engineering team monitors the project and offers assistance to its implementation based on expertise.

Elata leverages [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/), a leading blockchain voting platform, to facilitate on-chain voting. Snapshot facilitates all votes and proposals without users having to incur gas fees, providing a clear and verifiable record of governance decisions. Additionally, Elata may utilize third-party audits and community oversight to further ensure the integrity of the voting process.

## Voting

The voting process for proposals consists of two stages:

### Stage 1: Initial voting

Proposals are first posted in the "governance forum" channel on the Elata Discord server. To advance to the next stage, a proposal must:

- Remain open for 2 days.
- Receive a majority of positive votes.

### Stage 2: Snapshot vote

If a proposal passes the initial voting stage, it is then submitted to an off-chain decentralized voting platform known as [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/). To be validated on Snapshot, a proposal must:

- Achieve a quorum of 15% of circulating tokens.
- Secure a majority of positive votes.
- Remain open for 4 days.

Once a proposal successfully passes both stages, the Elata community will execute it.
