## Engineering team

The Engineering Team builds and maintains the core technology stack powering Elata’s mission. From open-source neuroimaging hardware that captures brainwave or behavioral data to decentralized software that processes and protects these data streams, this team bridges cutting-edge innovations in neuroscience, ML/AI, cryptography, and web services. They are responsible for the following:

- Developing open-source hardware for capturing relevant biomarkers or treating mental health issues (e.g., EEG, TMS, light/actigraphy sensors).
- Designing secure, privacy-preserving data pipelines, including those leveraging zero-knowledge proofs.
- Creating machine learning models aimed at mental health applications, especially computational neuroscience and psychiatry.
- Maintaining and expanding Elata’s suite of web services, such as our open-source news aggregator, contributor portals, and governance tools.
- Working in tandem with other teams to translate open-source insights into practical and profitable solutions that sustain the DAO.

- Cultivate and sustain a vibrant, supportive community, ensuring active member participation and retention.

## Stewardship & Core

Each team is guided by a steward, which are elected by [ELTA](/o/WFdlYgzLkzXseCEviHTq/s/Jfp0pu5VZ5XDDYs5IrR4/~/changes/108/operating-model/the-elta-token/elta-overview) holders. Stewards act as leaders, ensuring the smooth operation and direction of their respective working groups.

ElataCore is an advisory group that represents various groups of stakeholders. They are not a “Board of Directors”, but rather the opposite: ElataCore supports the Stewards. ElataCore is accountable to tokenholders, who define the scope of ElataCore's executive power over operational decisions and may refine these at any time in a new governance proposal.

Each ElataCore member is chosen to support a specific strategic objective of the DAO. In that sense, holders of our tokens are represented by ElataCore, but the token holders are the overseeing and superior entity that governs ElataCore through proposals.

To facillitate impartial decision-making, a clear separation between ElataCore and stewards will be indicated in Governance initiatives. This allows ElataCore to prioritize the highest-impact initiatives while stewards provide unbiased oversight. However, resource and contributor limitations may necessitate some overlap. The ultimate goal remains a clear and practical division between the two groups.
