Elata is a neurotech platform that brings together brain-signal technology to understand patterns, sustainable economic design (so engagement is fairly rewarded), and an open network (so anyone can join from anywhere).

As a user or builder, you engage through everyday apps and non-invasive commercial neurotech devices, and over time Elata automatically shifts your activity into smarter experiences, fair rewards, and more opportunities across the whole ecosystem.

Engage with Elata and choose the capabilities that best suits your invention. From user-centric neurometrics apps to creator-first monetization and built-in distribution.
