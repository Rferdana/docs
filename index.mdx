## Introduction

Elata is an open-source initiative where contributors produce and support top-notch projects for a broad range of indications spanning neuroscience and psychiatry, including solutions in neuroimaging, Artificial Intelligence (AI) training and app development, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), data encryption, digital assets, and eventually more capital-intensive projects such as therapeutics development.

To achieve our goals, Elata produces individual open-source projects up into distinct modules which aim to collectively support our mission to advance the field of neuropsychiatry.

Similar to how Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has fundamentally changed the financial services industry and monetary economics, Elata hopes to make a like impact as to how fiscal policy is carried out with respect to neuroscience and mental health R&D spending.

## Why build onchain?

Governance and management of Elata's resources will be carried out using [DAO Governance](https://ethereum.org/dao/).

Building onchain is the most sensible solution to our issue, as it can combine advantageous aspects of centralization and decentralization, is modular, and generally adopts characteristics from corporations and non-profits while remaining fundamentally distinct from both.

The biopharma industry has long struggled with data silos, poor alignment of incentives, riskiness, and as a result, innovation.

Private industry has widely divested from the core R&D areas Elata are working on, and tends to struggle with incentive alignment and transparency. On the flip side, non-profits and public sector spinouts tend to struggle with efficiency, productization, and capital formation.

We see implementing our solution onchain as a practical way of tackling these issues for the following reasons:

- Is decentralized, is free of barriers to entry, and perhaps even more focused on ethics, meaning anyone can contribute to and partake in the upside of successful efforts.
- Can cover the high costs typically associated with R&D using funds from the DAO treasury.
- Can be scalable both modular (many initiatives can be executed simultaneously) at the same time.
- Is borderless; anyone can share data, contribute research and information, find new opportunities, and develop new open-source technologies.
- Forces transparency. Neuroscience-related technologies (in all forms) will undoubtably be consequential to society as a whole.

## The vision

Neuroscience-related conditions - particularly mood disorders - are amongst the most economically and socially devastating public health concerns, yet progress to curb this issue has been remarkably stagnant. Efforts to develop superior diagnostics and treatments have largely failed, and historically exist solely in the hands of opaque corporate trade secret agreements and state-sponsored programs.

Elata's vision is to build an alternative open-source ecosystem that counters the issues stated above: a decentralized open-source project that anyone can contribute data to, develop new technologies under, and facilitate new research through at massive scale. Under this framework, Elata not only solves to operate consequential technology development initiatives with maximum transparency, but we also strive to achieve a level of data scalability and personalization that has not yet been possible in neuroscience - until now.

## Operations overview

To carry out its strategy, Elata will support an open ecosystem comprising various technologies - which will be commonly referred to as 'the ecosystem' - as apart of a multi-pronged architecture. All initiatives can be found on the Elata GitHub page, and links can be found below. As of writing, Elata is actively maintaining the following initiatives:

- **ZORP Protocol**: An onchain research standard that facilitates trustless participation, data encryption, and payment mechanisms pertaining to clinical research in mood and brain disorders without compromising patient privacy.
- **Elata EEG**: A fully right to repair low-cost EEG hardware unit built using commodity hardware components. As an EEG device, use cases for Elata EEG can be incredibly open-ended and are ultimately supported by Elata EEG's Plugin & App ecosystem.
