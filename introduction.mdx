## Overview

Neurotechnology is quickly becoming one of the most important technology classes in the world. To scale and ensure this transition is done properly, neuro-devices — and therefore minds — need a frictionless way to interact with one another over the internet. Blockchain accomplishes this by providing permissionless, transparent, and trustless infrastructure required for both economic coordination and public accountability.

The conventional model of facilitating R&D, funding developers to produce people-centric products, and coordinating neuro-devices is increasingly obsolete. We introduce a tokenized framework designed to mobilize both finances and people around the development of neurotech apps in a device-agnostic manner. By combining open-source development with token-based incentive structures, this approach directly links financial outcomes to a host of neuro-performance metrics and accelerates builder feedback cycles—resulting in faster iteration, stronger alignment, and therefore superior neuro performance outcomes.

## Why Elata is building onchain

_Governance and management of Elata resources will be carried out using _[**_DAO Governance_**](https://ethereum.org/dao/)___.___

Building onchain is the most sensible solution to our issue, as it can combine advantageous aspects of centralization and decentralization, is modular, and generally adopts characteristics from corporations and non-profits while remaining fundamentally distinct from both.

Broader private-sector efforts have widely divested from the core R&D areas Elata are working on, and tends to struggle with incentive alignment and transparency. On the flip side, non-profits and public sector spinouts tend to struggle with efficiency, productization, and capital formation.

We see implementing our solution onchain as a practical way of tackling these issues for the following reasons:

- Is decentralized, is free of barriers to entry, and perhaps even more focused on ethics, meaning anyone can contribute to and partake in the upside of successful efforts.
- Can be scalable both modular (many initiatives can be executed simultaneously) at the same time.
- Is borderless; anyone in the world can share data by engaging with apps or experiments, contribute ideas, benefit economically, and develop new open-source technologies.
- Forces transparency. Neuroscience-related technologies (in all forms) will undoubtably be consequential to society as a whole.

## Our vision: The Global Brain Operating System

Neuroscience-related conditions are amongst the most economically and socially devastating public health concerns, yet progress to curb this issue has been remarkably stagnant. Efforts to develop superior diagnostics and treatments have largely failed, and combative efforts historically exist solely through opaque trade secret agreements and state-sponsored inititatives.

Elata is building the alternative: a completely open ecosystem where anyone can contribute data, develop technologies, and facilitate new research through on a global scale.

Elata's vision is to build the alternative open ecosystem that counters these issues: a decentralized open project that anyone can contribute data to, develop technologies in, and facilitate new research through at massive scale. Under this framework, Elata not only solves to operate consequential technology development initiatives with maximum transparency, but we also strive to achieve a level of data scalability and personalization that has not yet been possible in neuroscience - until now.

## Operations overview

To carry out its strategy, Elata will support an open ecosystem comprising various technologies - which will be commonly referred to as 'the ecosystem' - as apart of a multi-pronged architecture. All initiatives can be found on the Elata GitHub page, and links can be found below. As of writing, Elata is actively maintaining the following initiatives:

- **ZORP Protocol**: An onchain R&D standard to facilitate both trustless and permissionless participation, data encryption, and experiment financing mechanisms pertaining to clinical research in mood and brain disorders without compromising patient privacy.
- **Elata EEG**: A fully right to repair low-cost EEG hardware unit built using commodity hardware components. As an EEG device, use cases for Elata EEG can be incredibly open-ended and are ultimately supported by Elata EEG's Plugin & App ecosystem.
