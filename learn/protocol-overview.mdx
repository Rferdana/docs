## Overview

Elata lets you launch neurotech apps with their own tokens — no fundraising, no gatekeepers. You bring the app, we handle the token economics.

<Info>
  **Network**: Live on **Base Sepolia** (testnet). Mainnet on **Base** coming soon.

## Why This Exists

Building neurotech is hard. Getting paid for it is harder. Most developers either join a closed platform that takes ownership of their work, or spend months chasing grants and investors instead of building.

Elata flips this: launch an app, get a token, start earning from day one. Users who believe in your app can buy in early and share in its success.

## What Elata Does

The short version: permissionless app launches with built-in token economics.

### If You're Building

- **Pay 110 ELTA**, get a token with 1 billion supply
- **Keep 50%** of your token, auto-staked and earning fees
- **Sell the other 50%** through a bonding curve — price goes up as people buy
- **Add features** like tournaments, NFT items, staking rewards

No smart contract development needed. The infrastructure deploys automatically.

### If You're Using or Investing

- **Browse apps** on the App Store
- **Buy tokens early** through bonding curves (lower price = earlier)
- **Stake tokens** to earn 70% of trading fees
- **Lock ELTA as veELTA** for governance votes and 15% of all protocol fees

## The Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Developer Launches App] --> B[App Token Created]
    B --> C[Users Buy Tokens via Bonding Curve]
    C --> D[Trading Fees Generated]
    D --> E[70% to App Stakers]
    D --> F[15% to veELTA Holders]
    D --> G[15% to Treasury]
    E --> H[Rewards Distributed]
    F --> H
```

1. **Launch**: Pay 110 ELTA → get 1B tokens (50% yours, 50% for sale)
2. **Trade**: Bonding curve sets price based on demand. 1% fee on every trade.
3. **Earn**: Fees split 70/15/15 — stakers, veELTA holders, treasury
4. **Graduate**: Hit 42,000 ELTA raised → liquidity moves to Uniswap, LP locked for 2 years

## Key Pieces

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|---------|
| **ELTA** | Protocol token. Used to launch apps and trade. |
| **veELTA** | Locked ELTA. Gets you votes + 15% of fees. |
| **App Tokens** | Each app's own token. 1B supply per app. |
| **Bonding Curves** | Sets price based on demand until graduation. |
| **Staking Vaults** | Stake app tokens → earn 70% of that app's fees. |
