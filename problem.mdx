## Background

We believe that neurotechnology will be one of the most defining technologies of the future. To scale and ensure this transition is done properly, neuro-devices — and therefore minds — need a frictionless way to interact with one another over the internet. Blockchain accomplishes this by providing permissionless, transparent, and trustless infrastructure required for both economic coordination and public accountability.

The conventional model of facilitating R&D, funding developers to produce people-centric products, and coordinating neuro-devices is increasingly obsolete. We introduce a tokenized framework designed to mobilize both finances and people around the development of neurotech apps in a device-agnostic manner. By combining open-source development with token-based incentive structures, this approach directly links financial outcomes to a host of neuro-performance metrics and accelerates builder feedback cycles—resulting in faster iteration, stronger alignment, and therefore superior neuro performance outcomes.

Despite its prospective importance, the entire field of neurotech is bottlenecked by a fundamental data problem, preventing the next leap forward:

1. Brain and mood disorders carry huge costs social and economic costs, but treatment progress remains slow.
2. Siloed neuro-devices and data make valuable brain insights unusable.
3. AI in neuro R&D is stalled by scarce, poor-quality data, limiting breakthroughs.
