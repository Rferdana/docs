title: "The Problem"

---

Despite its prospective importance, the entire field of neurotech is bottlenecked by a fundamental data problem, preventing the next leap forward:

1. Brain and mood disorders carry huge costs, but treatment progress remains slow.
2. Siloed neuro-devices and data make valuable brain insights unusable.
3. AI in neuro R&D is stalled by scarce, poor-quality data, limiting breakthroughs.
