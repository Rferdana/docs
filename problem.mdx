title: "The Problem"

1. **Brain and mood disorders pose a massive economic and social burden, yet interventional progress has been relatively stagnant.**
2. **Siloed Hardware & Data is all too common: Every neuro-device (EEG, BCI) speaks a different language. This fragmentation renders the world's most valuable brain data unusable for large-scale analysis.**
3. **A Performance Plateau in R&D: Current AI models are starved of high-quality, large-scale data. This forces them into a zone of "overfitting" where they fail to generalize, preventing breakthroughs in diagnostics and personalized medicine.**
