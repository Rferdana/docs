## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Elata?">
    A protocol for launching neurotech apps with their own tokens. You build an app, pay 110 ELTA to launch, and get a token that trades on a bonding curve. Users can buy in early, stake for fees, and participate in governance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why does this exist?">
    Building neurotech is hard. Getting paid for it is harder. Most devs either join closed platforms or spend months fundraising. Elata lets you launch with built-in economics — no VCs, no gatekeepers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What blockchain?">
    **Base** — Coinbase's L2. Low fees, fast transactions, Ethereum security.
    
    Currently live on **Base Sepolia** (testnet). Mainnet soon.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I get testnet tokens?">
    1. **ETH for gas**: [Alchemy Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia) or [QuickNode](https://faucet.quicknode.com/base/sepolia)
    2. **ELTA**: DM [@elata_bio](https://x.com/elata_bio) your wallet address
    
    Testnet tokens have no value. Testing only.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is it audited?">
    Uses OpenZeppelin standards. Contracts are non-upgradeable and open source. Formal audit before mainnet.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## ELTA Token

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's ELTA for?">
    - **Launch apps** — costs 110 ELTA
    - **Buy app tokens** — ELTA is the trading pair
    - **Governance** — lock as veELTA to vote
    - **Earn** — veELTA holders get 15% of all fees
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How much ELTA exists?">
    77 million max. Hard cap, can't be changed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Where do I get ELTA?">
    **Testnet**: DM [@elata_bio](https://x.com/elata_bio) your wallet address.
    
    **Mainnet**: Uniswap, or sell app tokens you own.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's veELTA?">
    Lock ELTA for 7 days to 2 years → get veELTA. Longer lock = more veELTA (up to 2x). veELTA = voting power + 15% of protocol fees.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I sell veELTA?">
    No. Non-transferable. Stops vote-buying.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## App Tokens

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do app tokens work?">
    Each app gets an ERC-20 with 1B supply. 50% goes to the creator (auto-staked), 50% sells on a bonding curve. 1% fee on all trades.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's a bonding curve?">
    Math that sets price based on how many tokens have sold. Early = cheap. More buyers = higher price. You can always buy or sell — the curve provides liquidity.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's 'Raising' mean?">
    Bonding curve is active. Buy directly from the curve, price goes up with demand.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's 'Live' mean?">
    Graduated. Hit 42,000 ELTA. Now trades on Uniswap instead of the curve.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens at graduation?">
    Curve hits 42K ELTA → liquidity moves to Uniswap → LP locked 2 years → free market trading starts → curve closes forever.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Staking & Rewards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I earn?">
    Two ways:
    1. **Stake app tokens** → 70% of that app's fees
    2. **Lock ELTA as veELTA** → 15% of all protocol fees
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the 70/15/15 split?">
    Every fee gets split: 70% to app stakers, 15% to veELTA holders, 15% to treasury.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is staking locked?">
    **App staking**: No lock. Unstake anytime.
    **veELTA**: Yes, you choose 7 days to 2 years when you lock.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When can I claim?">
    Anytime. No deadline. Just watch gas costs on small amounts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What token are rewards in?">
    ELTA. Always ELTA, no matter which app you staked.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Building Apps

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much to launch?">
    110 ELTA. 100 seeds your curve, 10 goes to treasury.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What do I get?">
    - 500M tokens (50%), auto-staked and earning
    - Ability to add tournaments and items
    - Full control of app content
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I update after launch?">
    Yes — app files, description, links, team. No — token supply, fee rate.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What can I build?">
    Anything that runs in a browser. Focus tools, games, wellness apps, research platforms. Neurotech focus but not enforced.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need Solidity?">
    No. Contracts deploy automatically. You just build the frontend.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tournaments & Items

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are tournaments?">
    Competitions with entry fees. Pay to enter, compete, winners split the pool.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do prizes work?">
    96.5% to winners, 2.5% protocol fee, 1% burned.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are items?">
    NFTs that unlock features or cosmetics. When someone buys, the payment burns — shrinks token supply.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can items be traded?">
    Builder decides. Can be soulbound (stuck to buyer) or tradeable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## XP System

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's XP?">
    Reputation score. Non-transferable, can't be bought.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's it for?">
    - **Early access**: 6-hour head start on new app launches
    - **LotPool voting**: Weight in funding rounds
    - **Reputation**: Proof you actually use the protocol
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I get XP?">
    Participate: tournaments, data contributions, community stuff.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I sell XP?">
    No. Soulbound. That's the point.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Safety & Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is this safe?">
    **Risks**:
    - Token prices can go to zero
    - Most apps won't succeed
    - Only risk what you can lose
    
    **Protections**:
    - LP locked 2 years (no rug pulls)
    - Contracts can't be changed post-deploy
    - All code is open source
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if a creator disappears?">
    LP stays locked, liquidity stays. Token keeps trading. Community can fork or continue the app.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I verify contracts?">
    Check address against docs, verify on Basescan, only use links from official sources. Don't interact with random contracts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
