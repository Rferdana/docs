## A User-Centric Global Brain Operating System

Building a global brain OS is a practical solution to the problems previously discussed. In pursuing such a mission, it is important to also consider economic incentives and user-friendly applications.

To address this issue, we propose an App development and adjacent tokenizaiton system that sits on top of the Brain OS. Not only does this help to create the conditions for a fundamental shift in how we understand the brain, but it coordinates existing neurotech actors — from users to developers — in a way that has not yet been done before.

## Our Solution: The Foundation for a Breakthrough

1. **Elata Brain OS:** A universal bridge that connects any device to a global network.
2. **Standardized Data and APIs:** Make it simple and easy for developers to build a variety of apps — from wellness and gaming to clinical R&D — on our platform.
3. **Tokenization Mechanisms:** Construct a decentralized economy to coordinate neurotech innovation by incentivizing app builders, app users, and protocol stakers simultaneously.
4. **Apps for Everyday Users:** Create fun and rewarding experiences for everyday users through apps that translate brain data into wellness, recreational, and research experiences.
