## Overview

Two ways to buy app tokens:

| Status | Where |
|--------|-------|
| **Raising** | Bonding curve (price set by formula) |
| **Live** | DEX like Uniswap (free market) |

<Warning>
  **Testnet Notice**: Elata is currently live on **Base Sepolia** (testnet). Mainnet launch on **Base** is coming soon. All tokens on testnet have no real monetary value.

## Buying on Bonding Curves

When an app is in "Raising" status, you buy directly from the bonding curve.

### How It Works

1. **Price increases with demand**: Early buyers get lower prices
2. **Instant liquidity**: Buy and sell anytime
3. **1% trading fee**: Applied to all transactions
4. **No slippage worries**: Price determined by curve formula

### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find an App">
    Browse the [App Store](https://app.elata.bio) and click on an app in "Raising" status
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    In the Buy section, enter how much ELTA you want to spend
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Quote">
    See how many tokens you'll receive and the effective price
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve ELTA">
    First transaction: approve the bonding curve to spend your ELTA
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Purchase">
    Second transaction: execute the buy order
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tokens Received">
    App tokens appear in your wallet immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding the Quote

When you enter an amount, you'll see:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **You Pay** | ELTA amount including fee |
| **You Receive** | App tokens you'll get |
| **Price** | Effective price per token |
| **Trading Fee** | 1% of purchase amount |
| **Price Impact** | How much your order moves the price |

### Price Impact

Large orders affect the price:
- Small orders (<1% of curve): Minimal impact
- Medium orders (1-5%): Noticeable price increase during execution
- Large orders (>5%): Significant price impact, consider splitting

---

## Selling on Bonding Curves

You can sell back to the curve at any time.

### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to App Page">
    Navigate to the app whose tokens you want to sell
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Sell Tab">
    Switch from Buy to Sell in the trading interface
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Specify how many app tokens to sell
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Quote">
    See ELTA you'll receive (after 1% fee)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve Tokens">
    If first time, approve the curve to spend your app tokens
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Sale">
    Execute the sell order
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Selling Considerations

- **Price decreases**: Selling pushes the curve price down
- **Fee applies**: 1% trading fee on sales too
- **Instant settlement**: ELTA received immediately

---

## Trading on DEX (Live Apps)

After an app graduates (reaches 42,000 ELTA), it trades on decentralized exchanges.

### Where to Trade

- **Uniswap**: Most common
- **Other Base DEXes**: Check app page for links
- **Aggregators**: 1inch, Paraswap, etc.

### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find DEX Link">
    On the app's detail page, click the DEX/Uniswap link
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Wallet">
    Connect your wallet on the DEX
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Trade">
    Enter ELTA amount to swap for app tokens (or vice versa)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review & Confirm">
    Check slippage, price impact, and confirm
  </Step>
</Steps>

### DEX vs Bonding Curve

| Feature | Bonding Curve | DEX |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| **Price** | Formula-based | Market-based |
| **Liquidity** | Always available | Depends on pool |
| **Slippage** | Predictable | Variable |
| **Fee** | 1% fixed | ~0.3% + gas |

## Price Charts

### On App Pages

Each app page shows:
- **Live price feed**
- **Historical chart**
- **Trading volume**

### External Charts

For graduated apps:
- **DexScreener**: Detailed trading analytics
- **GeckoTerminal**: Price tracking
- **Basescan**: On-chain data

---

## Understanding Prices

### Bonding Curve Pricing

Price follows a mathematical curve:
- Starts low with few tokens sold
- Increases as more tokens are purchased
- Decreases when tokens are sold back

### After Graduation

Price determined by:
- Supply and demand
- Liquidity pool depth
- Market sentiment

---

## Trading Fees

### On Bonding Curve

**1% trading fee** on every transaction:
- 70% → App token stakers
- 15% → veELTA holders
- 15% → Treasury

### On DEX

Typical DEX fees:
- **0.3%** Uniswap fee
- **Gas costs** for transactions

### Transfer Fee

App tokens also have a **1% transfer fee**:
- Applied when sending tokens between wallets
- Same distribution as trading fees

---

## Tips

- **Start small** — learn the system before going big
- **Check price impact** — large orders move the price, split if needed
- **Base gas is cheap** — but watch during congestion
- **Set slippage** — 0.5-1% on DEX trades
- **Verify contracts** — check address on app page before trading

## Tax Considerations

<Warning>
  Crypto trading may have tax implications. Consult a tax professional for advice specific to your jurisdiction.
</Warning>

Consider tracking:
- Purchase prices (cost basis)
- Sale proceeds
- Trading fees paid
- Holding periods
