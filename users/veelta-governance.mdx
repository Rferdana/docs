## Why Lock ELTA?

### Earn Protocol Fees

veELTA holders receive **15% of all protocol fees**:

- Trading fees from every app
- App launch fees
- Tournament fees

Distributed proportionally by veELTA balance.

### Governance Power

Vote on:

- Protocol parameters
- Fee adjustments
- Treasury allocations
- New feature proposals

### Duration Boost

Longer locks = More veELTA:

| Lock Duration | Boost | 1,000 ELTA → |
| ------------- | ----- | ------------ |
| 7 days (min)  | 1.01x | 1,010 veELTA |
| 6 months      | 1.25x | 1,250 veELTA |
| 1 year        | 1.5x  | 1,500 veELTA |
| 2 years (max) | 2.0x  | 2,000 veELTA |

---

## How It Works

### The Lock Mechanism

1. **Choose amount**: How much ELTA to lock
2. **Choose duration**: 7 days to 2 years
3. **Receive veELTA**: Proportional to amount × duration boost
4. **Earn & vote**: Until lock expires
5. **Unlock**: Receive original ELTA back

### Key Properties

| Property                   | Details                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Non-transferable**       | veELTA cannot be sold or sent         |

| **No early unlock**        | Must wait until expiry                |
| **No decay**               | veELTA balance stays constant         |
| **Full principal back**    | Receive 100% of locked ELTA on unlock |

## Comparing Options

### veELTA vs App Staking

|                   | veELTA              | App Staking     |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| **What you lock** | ELTA                | App tokens      |
| **Fee share**     | 15% protocol-wide   | 70% per-app     |
| **Lock required** | Yes (7d-2y)         | No              |
| **Voting power**  | Protocol governance | App-level only  |
| **Risk**          | ELTA price only     | App token price |

### Can Do Both

You can:

- Lock some ELTA as veELTA
- Buy app tokens with remaining ELTA
- Stake those app tokens

This diversifies your reward sources.

## Tips

- **Match lock to conviction** — bullish? go 2 years. Uncertain? start shorter.
- **More usage = more rewards** — veELTA yields depend on protocol activity
- **Vote** — you have the power, use it
- **Track taxes** — locking/unlocking/claiming may be taxable
